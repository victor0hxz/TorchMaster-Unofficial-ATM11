# Torchmaster - Unofficial Fan Build (26.1.2)

Adds the Mega Torch and related lighting utilities to control mob spawning in configurable areas. This NeoForge build adapts the original Torchmaster project to Minecraft 26.1.2.

## Unofficial fan build and credits

This adaptation was prepared by **victor0hxz** for the ATM11 compatibility project. It is an **unofficial version made by fans**, not an official release. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the original authors or the All the Mods team.

Original authors: **Xalcon**. [Original source project](https://github.com/Xalcon/TorchMaster). The original MIT license and copyright notices are preserved. The original mod authors retain credit for the mod and its content.

## Requirements and installation

Minecraft **26.1.2**, NeoForge and **Java 25**. No required mod dependencies beyond NeoForge 26.1.2.109.

Replace the older copy of the same mod; do not install the official build and this build together because the mod ID is unchanged. Keep Mekanism modules on matching versions. This older source build is a separate alternative to the Version Locked modules used by the newer Extras tests; mixing them has not been validated. Dependencies are not bundled.

## Validation and release status

JAR compilation and archive integrity verified. The available server validation log ends during asset downloads; a successful runtime test is not established by that log.

This initial file should be submitted as **Beta**, pending full-pack community gameplay tests. Do not interpret a compiled JAR as a guarantee that every gameplay scenario has been tested.

## Downloads and support

Download the unofficial prerelease JAR from [this repository's releases](https://github.com/victor0hxz/TorchMaster-Unofficial-ATM11/releases). Report problems to [this port's issue tracker](https://github.com/victor0hxz/TorchMaster-Unofficial-ATM11/issues). Do not direct port-specific support requests to the original authors.

## Build source

This repository preserves the local production source snapshot used by the compatibility project, including the original license. Install Java 25 and use the Gradle wrapper. Torchmaster: `gradlew.bat :neoforge:jar`; Mekanism and modules: `gradlew.bat jar`; SFM: run `gradlew.bat build` inside `platform/minecraft`. Original optional dependency versions remain in the inherited Gradle configuration. An uncached rebuild of this snapshot has not been validated in this publication step.
